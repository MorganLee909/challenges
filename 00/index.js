    CHALLENGE 00
    1.  Change the title to your name
    2.  Swap the two paragraphs.  The text in blue should in red and the text in
        red should be in blue.  Do not swap the colors, just the text
    3.  Make the above happen when the button is pressed.
    Bonus: The button should only work once.  Once you click it the first time,
        it willn no longer do anything

    Do not touch the HTML at all, not even to add classes.  Do this entirely
        in JavaScript
    If stuck, you can check solution.js.  Try to do it without checking.
